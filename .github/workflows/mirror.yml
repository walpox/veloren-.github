          Whether to convert Git LFS pointer files to their associated blob files, effectively disabling Git LFS in the mirror.
          By default, LFS will be included in the mirror repository.
          Be careful when enabling this option because it may increase the execution time of this workflow significantly.
          There are certain limits on GitHub so it is important to keep LFS disabled on some repositories.
